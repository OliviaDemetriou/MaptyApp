# Mapty App

This project is all about logging your running and cycling routes. It makes remembering where you've been really easy as its all visible on the map and stores everything in your local storage so when you close the app after using it and re-open it next time you want to use it all your previous routes are still there. It also has geolocation implimented into it so it knows where you are when you allow your location.

This project was created as part of my JavaScript course with Jonas Schmedtmann. The application was designed by him and he taught lectures to explain how the JavaScript for this application works and I followed along and coded the JS myself with his guidance. It was challenging at times, especially during the geolocation section however I got there in the end after many attempts to debug which I'm finding myself getting better and better at each time.
